The Scaffolded Volition Approach (SVA) begins with lessons attained from observations made across hundreds of therapeutic relationships: identical structured events producing radically different outcomes. It is whether engagement with life feels chosen or compelled.
When life feels compelled — driven by survival, necessity, or performance for others — even small obstacles become uncrossable. When engagement feels chosen — grounded in your own values, seen by someone who witnesses your fight — you can cross almost anything. Volition is not a personality trait. It is a condition that can be restored.
This approach is grounded in Ubuntu — the African philosophical understanding that a person is a person through other persons. You did not become who you are alone. You cannot heal alone either. What you need is not fixing. What you need is what was always needed: to be seen, cheered, aimed, and guided.
